# Portfolio Website

This repository is dedicated to my projects and future endeavors. It was built using languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in a Nodejs environment. This website also imported libraries that help make it more responsive and interactive with the users. React, Reactjs, and Threejs were key in the 3D designs and overall structure.

In the future, this website will be subject to change and improved upon.

To run the code, simply run the command line 'npm run dev' after installing npm. Then click on the local:host link.
This website will eventually get its domain and web host after we have finalized it.
